# Lab-Attendance-System-using-Web-App-and-RFID

“Lab Attendance system using web app & RFID” is a project implemented to automate the process of attendance system in schools, colleges and other educational institutions. Firstly, we created a table using database through SQL which consists of all the RFID tag details that are allocated uniquely for each and every student upon registration and this table also stores the name of the student, their in time and out time in periodic basis. This database acts as a back end module for our project. Secondly, we have designed a web application where the data of the student attendance in a particular time stamp will be displayed. This acts as a front-end module for our project. Further we integrated the front-end web app to the RFID technology hardware circuit which scans the tag given to the student based on their in time and out time and the data will be accessed by the faculty.
